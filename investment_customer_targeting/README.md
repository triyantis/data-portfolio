# Identifying High-Potential Customers for Investment Products Using Banking Behavior Data

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify prospects who are likely to purchase investment products and actively use mobile banking. Using fictional banking data, we apply segmentation and classification to uncover patterns and deliver actionable insights for marketing and product teams.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment customers based on financial behavior
- Predict likelihood of investment product purchase
- Identify drivers of mobile banking usage
- Recommend strategies for upselling

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- SQL for data querying
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Clustering: KMeans
- Tableau or Streamlit for dashboard

## 📂 Dataset
Synthetic data simulating 5,000 retail banking customers with fields like:
- Customer ID
- Age, Gender, Occupation
- Monthly Income, Account Balance
- Mobile Banking Usage Frequency (per week)
- Existing Investment Product (Yes/No)
- Credit Score
- Tenure (years with the bank)
- Avg Transaction Amount

## 🔍 Key Questions
- Who are the most likely customers to buy investment products?
- What factors are correlated with high mobile banking usage?
- Can we predict investment product uptake?
- What segments exist in our customer base?

- Customer Segmentation Plots
- Feature Importance for Investment Prediction
- Correlation Heatmap
- Mobile App Usage Distribution by Age/Income

## 🧠 Insights
- Customers with high income, long tenure, and frequent mobile app use are more likely to invest.
- Younger segments use mobile apps more often, but invest less.
- Specific clusters (e.g., tech-savvy professionals) show high potential for both.

## 📢 Recommendations
- Target segment: Age 30–45, income > Rp10 juta, tenure > 3 years
- Push personalized investment offers via mobile banking app
- Improve mobile UX for older customers to increase engagement
